# Clustering
This is a java application that clusters blog and wikipedia data by K-means and hierarchy with Pearson similarity.
Start by running the java application from your IDE of choice. You can also run the application using maven from the project root.

Run the front end using node by opening a terminal in the root of the project. Then run
```shell
npm install
```

Next time you start the application you can start it from the project root with
```shell
npm start
```
This will start a react app which can be accessed in the browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it doesn't automatically open.
